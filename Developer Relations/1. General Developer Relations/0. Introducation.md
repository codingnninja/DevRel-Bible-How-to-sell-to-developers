# DevRel Bible: How to Sell to Developers

It all started on 6th Feb. 2020 when I was sitting at my table researching more about DevRel challenges. 

Although I had been dabbling into developer relations before then, the talk I had to give at a conference led me to serious research about developer relations.

Along the line, I kept seeing phrases like “It is hard to sell to developers”, “Don’t sell to developers” and so on. 

As a person who is into business and also a software developer, I kept asking myself, why is it hard to sell to us? Are we not human beings like every other person? 

So, I started researching how to sell to developers and I found interesting things I am about to share with you in this write-up.
