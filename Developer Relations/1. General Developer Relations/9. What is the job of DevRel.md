# What is the job of DevRel?

Your job as a member of a DevRel team is to make developers want to buy whatever products you’re dealing with.

Making them want to buy is a necessity because a relationship that doesn’t provide for business expectations is a failure. 

Think about it. 

How will businesses pay salaries if they’re not making revenue? Did you just say “venture funds"? But can “venture funds” last forever? If not, developers need to buy.
